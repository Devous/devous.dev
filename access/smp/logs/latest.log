[16:19:32] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> I think some relocated so
[16:19:45] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> i was actually starting to like playing again
[16:19:52] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> oh well
[16:20:05] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> I wouldnt care much if I knew they didnt cheat
[16:20:07] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> but like
[16:20:36] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> they clearly didnt find the village
[16:20:58] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> i knew they would have found it but i didnt really think they would cheat as much as they have
[16:21:09] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> yhhh
[16:21:24] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> we only payed back to what they did beforehand
[16:21:34] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> that could have really been the end of it
[16:21:43] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> mhm
[16:22:08] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> whats the plan now
[16:22:34] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> no clue
[16:22:42] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> I would go blow up their shit but its like
[16:22:44] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> idk where they are
[16:23:05] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> theres no point now like
[16:23:09] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> we have nothing left really
[16:23:25] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> mhm
[16:23:28] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> theres nothing to need to be angry about if we just dont continue to play
[16:23:28] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> I have no clue
[16:24:03] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> poor morten
[16:24:06] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> i should have put my shulkers away man
[16:24:21] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> they have to had cheated
[16:24:27] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> 100%
[16:25:14] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> like theres no way unless they did what i said and chose a direction to go from our bedrock portal
[16:25:29] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> each to their own i suppose
[16:25:46] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> even so they would of had to covered thousands upon thousands of blocks
[16:26:15] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> i mean if they did it via nether ceiling and found our new portal it wouldnt have been too hard
[16:26:24] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> I mean yes it would
[16:26:43] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> bc even when you go out to the distance we travelled you would of had to searched far
[16:27:00] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> bc even if you looked 1 block to the side that could of been 1 thousand blocks to the side
[16:27:03] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> yeah idk they're probably reading logs and laughing at us
[16:27:11] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> plus with stuff not rendering in they would of been slowed
[16:27:15] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> idc
[16:27:35] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <niaori> id say create a new smp but is it really worth all the time and effort
[16:27:59] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> to make a small one probs
[16:28:07] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> we wont all spend lots of time on it
[16:28:15] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> but the amount of small time from being bored we would spend
[16:28:17] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <Slyix> it may be
[16:29:41] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <niaori> emily doesnt care much as she died and was at spawn anyway
[16:29:52] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <niaori> she wasnt going to join back i dont think
